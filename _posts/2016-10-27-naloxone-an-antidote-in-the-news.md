Not every antidote in toxicology gets the spotlight like naloxone does. And why is that? What is special about naloxone and what is it an antidote for anyway? I recently published [an article](/Naloxone_ The Science and Laws Behind the Antidote _ Health Law Section.pdf) for the attorney audience through the American Bar Association and shed some light on this prescription drug and the fight that it's trying to win. It doesn't stop there though. I'm taking the naloxone conversation on the road to speak to attorneys and pharmacists at the 2016 American Society for Pharmacy Law annual conference next month.&nbsp;
