categories:

It's not everyday that I get a room full of attorneys, who after a long day, want to learn some toxicology. But this week, I had not only a full room, but an engaged audience ready to learn about naloxone. This talk covered questions including: What is naloxone? How does it work? What are the reasons behind the opioid epidemic and how does naloxone fit in? How can this information help me with opioid-related cases (and how do I know if my case involves an opioid to begin with?) All these questions, and more, were covered in this 1-hour CLE course at Jenkins Law Library in Philadelphia.
