Rapidly sedating a toxicology patient who presents with excited delirium is a critical — yet often difficult — action. These patients are typically difficult to control and resistant to sedation with commonly used agents such as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. They also have high mortality rates. The key to obtaining good outcomes in these cases is prompt evaluation and support, focusing on the ABCs and hydration, as well as early detection and treatment of hypoglycemia and hyperthermia.
