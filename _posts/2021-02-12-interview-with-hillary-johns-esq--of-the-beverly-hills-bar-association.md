I had the pleasure of being interviewed in December 2020 by [Hillary Johns, Esq](https://www.hillaryjohnstriallawyermh.com/attorney/hillary-johns/)., a seasoned trial attorney from Beverly Hills, CA. Hillary has a podcast, Litigator's Corner, through the Beverly Hills Bar Association (BHBA). She posed some great questions related to drugs and alcohol (our specialty as toxicologists) in this 30-minute virtual interview.&nbsp; The topics in this interview are expanded upon in a soon-to-be launched minimum continuing legal education program through the BHBA (details to follow soon). Many thanks to Hillary and the BHBA\!
