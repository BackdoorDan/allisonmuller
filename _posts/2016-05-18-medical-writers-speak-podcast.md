Dr. Emma Hitt Nichols, CEO of Nascent Medical, has compiled interviews with medical writers about their careers, current work, and their specialties. I enjoyed doing an [interview](http://medicalwritersspeak.libsyn.com/podcast/allison-muller-pharmd-toxicologist-turned-med-writer)with her as she asked some great questions and made the interview an enjoyable experience.
