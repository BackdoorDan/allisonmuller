I recently gave a continuing legal education talk on medication safety. The goal of the talk was to provide tips to attorneys on how they can evaluate cases where a medication may have caused harm in a patient. Part of the presentation included a review of sources I recommend for reliable and free drug information. My handout with a list of references can be found [here](/handout 2 drug info sources for medication misadventures muller.pdf). One of the sources was the FDA prescribing information – what it is useful for and what it is not. Two guest bloggers, Anshika Singh and Jabin Mathew, two Doctor of Pharmacy students (class of '17) from Jefferson School of Pharmacy, address a question I’ve had regarding the utility of prescribing information specifically for toxicology-related information. &nbsp; Their response to this drug information question can be found here.
