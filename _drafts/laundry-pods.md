Davis and colleagues analyzed exposures to laundry and dishwasher detergents in two forms, packet and non-packet, in children under 6 years of age. (*Pediatrics,&nbsp;*May 2016) They looked at data compiled from all the U.S. poison control centers (2013-2014) and identified 62,254 cases where poison centers received reports of children under 6 being exposed to these products via skin, eye, or ingestion. Nearly 60% of these detergent exposures were from packets and the study authors noted an increase in laundry packet exposures over the course of the study. Not unexpectedly, children under 3 years of age made up the majority of the patients in this study (86%). Researchers found that there was not a significant difference in the odds of having serious medical outcomes or hospitalization between children exposed to dishwasher detergent packets and dishwasher non-packet products. However, the odds of children exposed to laundry detergent packets containing liquid had an odds twice that of those exposed to laundry packets containing granules of being admitted to a hospital. There were 104 children who were injured severely enough from laundry detergent packets that intubation was required and 2 children died following exposure to these packets. This study further relays safety concerns regarding liquid laundry detergent packets.

Even with the most child-friendly home, there is the risk for children getting into things that are harmful. Keeping these and other harmful household products out of reach and locked away are strategies to help keep young children safe from poisons. A third measure is to not have products with serious safety concerns in homes with young children.
