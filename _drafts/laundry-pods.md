Davis and colleagues analyzed exposures to laundry and dishwasher detergents in two forms, packet and non-packet, in children under 6 years of age. (*Pediatrics,&nbsp;*May 2016) They identified 62,254 cases (in 2013 and 2014) reported to U.S. poison control centers of children under 6 exposed to these products via skin, eye, or ingestion . Nearly 60% of these detergent exposures were from packets and the study authors noted an increase specifically in laundry packet exposures over the course of the study. Not unexpectedly, children under 3 years of age made up the majority of the patients in this study (86%). Researchers found that there was not a significant difference in the odds of having serious medical outcomes or hospitalization between children exposed to dishwasher detergent packets and dishwasher non-packet products. However, the odds of children exposed to laundry detergent packets containing liquid were at twice the risk of those exposed to laundry packets containing granules of being admitted to a hospital. There were 104 children who were injured severely enough from laundry detergent packets that intubation was required and 2 children died following exposure to these packets. This study further relays safety concerns regarding liquid laundry detergent packets.

Even with the most child-friendly home, there is the risk for children getting into dangerous products. Children watch what we do and quickly learn how to gain access to things in cabinets and on shelves. Keeping detergents and other harmful household products out of reach and locked away are strategies to help keep young children safe from poisons. A third measure is to not have products with serious safety concerns in homes with young children.
