I had the pleasure of speaking to an engaged group of attorneys this week at the Jenkins Law Library in Philadelphia. I gave a one-hour continuing legal education (CLE) talk on how attorneys can sort through the details of medical charts to learn of any "medication misadventures". What are "medication misadventures"? How do medication misadventures occur? What are some red flags to look for when going through medical charts? What are some valuable sources of drug information for the non-healthcare-professional? If you have an hour (or just want to skip around this video of the program), learn some of this and more.
