I frequently get calls from attorneys who have a case that may be related to a medication. Could a medication (or combination of medications) have been responsible for a patient's symptoms? That is always a complicated question and requires more than just a simple list of medications that the patient takes. So what detective work can an attorney do before calling for a toxicology consult? There are some questions that attorneys can answer themselves with this checklist and also some answers they can provide to their toxicology or medical consultant before deciding on the viability of a case.
