title: '"Medication Misadventures: 10 Tips for Attorneys" CLE Course'

I had the pleasure of speaking to an engaged group of attorneys this week at the Jenkins Law Library in Philadelphia, PA. I gave a one-hour continuing legal education (CLE) talk on how attorneys can sort through the details of medical charts to identify and understand any possible "medication misadventures". What are medication misadventures anyway? How do medication misadventures occur? What are some red flags to look for when going through medical charts? What are some valuable sources of drug information for the non-healthcare-professional? If you have an hour (or just want to skip around this video of the program), you can get these, and perhaps many more, questions about medication safety answered.
